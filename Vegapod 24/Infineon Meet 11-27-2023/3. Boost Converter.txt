1. Power- 20kW
2. Input voltage - 150V to 200V
3. Output Voltage - 500 - 600V
4. Size Constraint - Lower Inductance, Higher Frequency
5. Inductance - 10uH to 20uH
6. Frequency - Over 200kHz (in order to minimize inductor ripple current and hence, losses)
7. Powers the inverter which in turn powers the Induction Motor.
